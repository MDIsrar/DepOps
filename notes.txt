DevOps (Develop Team & Operation Team) Overview
(DevOps is not a Technology. It is Methodology.)
	Waterfall Model->
		Traditional Waterfall Model->
			Requirement and Gathering Analysis
			Design
			Implement
			Test
			Deploy
			Maintenance
			
			Disadvantage ->
				If application have any bug. You have to go through the entire source to find the bug.
	
	What is Agile Methodology?
		1. In the Agile Methodology each project is broken up into several 'iterations'
		2. All Iterations should be of the same time duration (between 2 to 8 weeks)
		3. At the end of each iteration, a working product should be delivered
		
	DevOps Stages->
		Version Control -> Maintains different versions of the code (Source Code Management)
		Continous Integration -> Compile, validate, Code Review, Unit Testing, Integration Testing (Continous Build) (Jenkins Tool)
		Continous Delivery -> Deploying the build application to test servers, Performing UAT (Continous Testing)
		Continous Deployment -> Deploying the tested application on the prod server for release (Configuration Management & Containerization (Docker)) (Puppet)
		
		Continous Monitoring Tool -> Nagios

Introduction to Docker : timeStamp : 2:56:59 ->
	Why we need Docker? : timeStamp : 2:57:58 ->
		An application works in developer's laptop not in testing or production. This is due to difference in computing between Dev, Test and Prod.
		in Dev there can be a software that is upgraded and in Prod the old version of software might be present.
	What is Docker? : timeStamp : 3:01:49 -> Docker is containerization platform.
